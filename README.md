## Description

**Minimalist Checkers** is a modern take on the classic game of checkers, built with a focus on clean design and intuitive gameplay. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally, capturing opponents' pieces, and promoting their pieces to kings. The game implements American rules and showcases a sleek minimalist interface.

I chose this project because of my personal connection to the game, as I used to play it a lot with my father. Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself to see how well I could recreate this game independently while building on my skills in logic, DOM manipulation, and CSS design.

## Getting Started

- [Play the Game Here](https://minimalistcheckers.surge.sh/)

### Instructions

1. **Objective:** Capture all of your opponent‚Äôs pieces or block them from making any moves.
2. **How to Play:**
    - Regular pieces move diagonally forward.
    - Kings can move diagonally in any direction.
    - Jump over opponent pieces to capture them.
    - Perform multiple captures in a single turn if possible.
3. **Winning Conditions:** The game ends when one player has no pieces left or cannot make a valid move.

# User Stories

- As a player, I want any captured opponent pieces to disappear from the board, so that I can clearly see my progress in the game.

# Pseudocode

1. **Variables Needed:** Set up variables to track the board layout, which player‚Äôs turn it is, and possible moves.

2. **Main Elements on Page:** Link to the main game area, turn display, messages, and restart button.

3. **Set Up the Game at Start:** Load the board, pieces, and show whose turn it is.

4. **How the Game Looks:** Show the pieces in their places and display whose turn it is.

5. **Game Rules and Setup:** Define board size (8x8), colors for each player (black and white), and normal vs. king pieces.

6. **Piece Clicks:** When a player clicks a piece, check if it‚Äôs their turn and show possible moves.

7. **Find Valid Moves:** Calculate where each piece can move, depending on the type (normal or king).

8. **Click on a Square to Move:** Move the piece if the player clicks a valid square, removing any captured pieces.

9. **Turn Change:** Switch to the next player, clear highlights, and update the display.

10. **Check for Win/Loss:** If a player has no moves or pieces left, announce the winner; otherwise, continue turns.

11. **Restart the Game:** Reset everything to start a new game when the player clicks the reset button.

12. **Improve Display and Accessibility:** Make sure the colors are easy to see, messages are clear, and pieces have labels for accessibility.
