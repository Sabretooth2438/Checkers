## Description

**Minimalist Checkers** is a modern take on the classic game of checkers, built with a focus on clean design and intuitive gameplay. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally, capturing opponents' pieces, and promoting their pieces to kings. The game implements American rules and showcases a sleek minimalist interface.

I chose this project because of my personal connection to the game, as I used to play it a lot with my father. Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself to see how well I could recreate this game independently while building on my skills in logic, DOM manipulation, and CSS design.

## Getting Started

- [Play the Game Here](https://sabretooth2438.github.io/Checkers/)

### Instructions

1. **Objective:** Capture all of your opponent‚Äôs pieces or block them from making any moves.
2. **How to Play:**
   - Regular pieces move diagonally forward.
   - Kings can move diagonally in any direction.
   - Jump over opponent pieces to capture them.
   - Perform multiple captures in a single turn if possible.
3. **Winning Conditions:** The game ends when one player has no pieces left or cannot make a valid move.
